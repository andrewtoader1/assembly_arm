This project consists of a microprocessor, a stepper motor, and a Toshiba ULN2003APG Darlington sink driver to power the stepper motor. When the left joystick button on the STM32L476 development board is pressed, the motor will rotate 145 deg. clockwise, then 145 deg counterclockwise back to the starting position. A schematic of the setup can be viewed in the file 'schematic.pdf'
