# Display a Code
This project uses a keypad, 1K Ohm resistors, and the STM32L476 development board equiped with the ARM M4 microprocessor. In this project, the user inputs a code on the keypad, and the last 6 numbers entered are shown on the screen. A schematic of the hardware connection of the keyboard to the development board is included in the file 'schematic.pdf'
